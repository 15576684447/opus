package opus

/*
// Statically link libopus. Requires a libopus.a in every directory you use this
// as a dependency in. Not great, but CGO doesn't offer anything better, right
// now. Unless you require everyone who USES this package to have libopus
// installed system-wide, which is more of a chore because it's so new. Everyone
// will end up having to build it from source anyway, might as well just dump
// the pre-built lib in here. At least it will be up to the package maintainer,
// not the user.
//
// If I missed something, and somebody knows a better way: please let me know.
